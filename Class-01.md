# Intro to HTML and JavaScript

# Structure   

 The structure refers to the overall flow of the page. HTML uses **elements** to describe the structure of the page.

- **Tags** act like containers. They tell about information between their opening and closing.
- **Attributes** provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the oopening of a tag.

# Extra Markup

**DOCTYPES** tells your browser what version of HTML you are using, HTML continues to evolve.
- **ID** attribute is used to give an element a unique identity. However, no ID can be the same!
- **Block elements** are used to start a new line in the browser window. (h1, li ,ul)
- **Inline elements** are used to appear as they are all on the same line. (a, b, em)

# HTML5 Layout
HTML5 is much like traditional elements, however, it is much more simplified.
- New elements have beed added such as: head, nav, footer, aside, ect. 

# Process & Design

- *Why* do people want to use the website?
- *What* do the users intend to achieve by using the website?
- *How* often will the website be used?

Site maps
- Help with planning out the structure of a site, much like a tree diagram. It's important to plan out the flow of your website so everything stays internal.

Wire frames
  - A wireframe is useful as a rough draft. They are a very basic look for the website. Where does everything go? How does it look when assembled?
