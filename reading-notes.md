# Reading Notes
- HTML uses tags whichs are characters that sit inside angled brackets. These tell you something about information that lies between them.
- Tags will usually come in pairs, an opening and closing. Its important to know what tags do and where they go. <> open / close </>
    - head, title, bold, i italics, br line break, hr horizontal rule, ect.

## Target audience
- Who is the audience, why are they coming, what is their goal? How are they accessing the site? These are all very important questions. It's critical to understand your audience and how to best serve them. 

## Site maps
- Help with planning out the structure of a site, much like a tree diagram. It's important to plan out the flow of your website so everything stays internal.

## wire frames
- A wireframe is useful as a rough draft. Wire frames present a very basic look for the website. Where does everything go? How does it look when assembled?
- Before coding create a wire frame. This will save you hours of re-factoring code. You need to know where you're going before you take off!

## Coloring, grouping and sizing.
- These are all critical components of a website. Colors and sizing can either grab someones attention to an area or completely hide it. Grouping can make a site look simplified rather than clustered.
