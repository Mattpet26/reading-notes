# Architecture and Logic

 - **Four things a computer is designed to do:**
    - Input information
    - Store information as data
    - Process information
    - Output results

- **What are the 1's and 0's?**
    - This is the binary system, a series of information that is represented by 0 and 1.
    - These numbers represent everything in the digital world. (every word, number, sound or letter is translated through 1 and 0.)

    - Although we may not work directly with the binary system, it is the backbone of computers.

- **Passing information**
    - Pressing a key on a keyboard turns that key into binary.
    - This information travels to the CPU. 
    - The CPU then requests instructions from the memory how to construct whatever key pressed.
    - The CPU then sends the pixels to memory to be stored.
    - The information is finally sent to the monitor as output, making up everything on the screen.

- There is a near infinate amounts of ways information is input and output.
    - The more complicated information means the more CPU and memory the computer will need.

**Hardware and Software**
- Hardware
    - This is all the wires, circuits, everything inside a physical computer.
    - CPU is the key component to hardware.
- Software
    - This is all the programs a computer runs.
    - Operating systems are the key component to software.
