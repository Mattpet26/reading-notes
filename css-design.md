- The last rule entered will be the one that takes precedence.

- It is important to keep css and html separate, however they can be within the same html document. 

# Four basic parts

- **Declaration**
    - Indicates how the elements  should be styled/look like. Splits into two parts, *property* and *value*.

- **Property and Value**
    - Properties indicate what aspect you want to change.
    - Values specify the settings you want.

- **Selector**
    - A selector indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if the element names are separated wtih commas.
