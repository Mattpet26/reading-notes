# Key concepts in positioning elements
- Building blocks
  - CSS treats each html element as if its in its own box. (Either block level or inline box)

- Containing elements
  - If one blocl level element sits inside another element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

- Positioning
  - **Float** allows us to take an element and place it in a direction. Float is useful for placing elements to be side by side.
  - **Absolute or Fixed** posiitons can be used to force the element to stay in one spot.
