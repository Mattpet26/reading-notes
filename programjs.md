# Programming with JavaScript

- Scripts are made up of instructions a computer follows step by step.
    - These steps are followed literally, one after another.

- Scripts are much like a manual or recipe we might use.
    - The difference is that a computer doesn't learn from this. Every program will be ran as if it were the first time ever running it.

1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step

- Flowcharts are useful when looking at different tasks to be performed. They can organize your goals before starting coding. 

 # **Expressions**

- There are only two types of expressions:
1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

 # **Operators**  
- Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
    - Assignment, arithmetic, string, logical, ect.

 # **Functions**
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
- Pieces of information passed to a function are known as **parameters**.
- When you ask a function to perform a task it is called **calling** the function
- The response the function gives you is known as **return value**. 

# **Functions**
- you have to declare a function and you have to invoke it for it to run
- Variables scoped within the function (local sclope) are only available within the function.
- Variables can be passed into a function. You can also pass other functions as an argument.

- Functions have parameters that take the argument passed by the function invoke.

 function doAthing(thing){   <- parameter <br>
    does a thing
}

 doAthing(thing);   <-Argument

- Remember to declare the variable

- D.O.M - Document object model

# A while loop
- Its a loop, you can't leave until the expression is correct (true/false)
- Enter loop. Test expression. 

- Whenever user opens they answer yes/no

- Answer yes or no? we can go forward.

- Answered "yupp", get another prompt for yes/no
- Answered "sure", get another prompt

# A for loop
- This type of loop is used to enter information a set amount of times before exiting the loop.

- Enter loop. Certain amount of tries.

- User starts at 1
- While tries is less than 4, enter loop.

- Answer question.

- When incorrect counter is now 2
- Is 2 less than 4? yes, redo loop

- After 4 tires exit loop.

# Logical Operators
- && logical and, both conditions must be true to be true statement
- || logical or, either condition can be true to be true statement
- ! logical not, reverses the stae of expression
