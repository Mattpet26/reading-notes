# Programming with JavaScript

- Scripts are made up of instructions a computer follows step by step.
    - These steps are followed literally, one after another.

- Scripts are much like a manual or recipe we might use.
    - The difference is that a computer doesn't learn from this. Every program will be ran as if it were the first time ever running it.

1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step

- Flowcharts are useful when looking at different tasks to be performed. They can organize your goals before starting coding. 

 # **Expressions**

- There are only two types of expressions:
1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

 # **Operators**  
- Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
    - Assignment, arithmetic, string, logical, ect.

 # **Functions**
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
- Pieces of information passed to a function are known as **parameters**.
- When you ask a function to perform a task it is called **calling** the function
- The response the function gives you is known as **return value**.
