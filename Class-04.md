# Html links
- Links are created using the < a> element.
- The < a> element uses the **href** attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- **Absolute link** is a full URL that takes the user externally.
- **Relative link** is an internal link.

# Layout
- < div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- The float property can move content left or right of the page to create multiple column layouts.
- Each html element is in its own box. 

# Functions, Methods and Objects
- The purpose of a function is to define a code block for LATER use.
- First we must delcare a function : Function potato()
- Next we must call the function, placing that function after the last curly braces.
- Global variable definitions
- Function definitions
- Function calls

function functionNamePotato(){
  //here is where code goes
}
function must be called here

- If information is entered into the parameter, they are now declared variables.
  - function sayHello(x, y , apple){

  }
- var x;
- var y;
- var apple;

now when we call the function with info, it has a value.

sayHello('anything', 'potato', 'dog')
- var anything = 'x'
- var potato = 'y'
- var dog = 'apple'
