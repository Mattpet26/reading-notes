#JavaScript

- Interactive part for users

- Return, take input, control values

- Statements and variables...

- Key value pairs
    - Everything in javascript is an object

- The four keys of Javascript
    - Loops(fort and while)
    - Conditional statments (if/else)
    - Functions
    - Arrays

- Scripts are saved in their own files. Like the follow along in class, css/js/html all had their own locations that we could pull from. This keeps everything organized.
