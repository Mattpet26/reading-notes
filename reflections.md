# Git and GitHub
- These are two different types of programs, but they are similar.
- Git is used through the terminal on a computer while Github is used on a website.

# Git
 **A few important takeaways are:**
    - A-C-P. Add, Commit, Push
- Add, command adds the content worked on into Git
- Commit, takes the content worked on and uploads it into a permanent state. It is also important to label the commit with what you did.
- Push, this action takes the work that you did and uploads it to GitHub.
    - When doing this it is important to ONLY edit the file with GitHub or Git. **NEVER** both, the file merging will cause errors.
