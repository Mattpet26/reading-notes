answer = loopTheThing(1) // runs 20 times
answer = loopTheThing(4) // runs 5 times

    // var - i can be anything, its potato; <br>
    // 2nd part is number of times to run, 20; <br>
    // third part is how i increases or decreases, +1 each time.
    //loopTheThing() this is declaring the function
    //what happens in function stays in function unless "return"


- **While Loop**

var answer = true;

while(answer != false){
    consol.log('Please enter an answer")
    answer = prompt('Enter true or false')
} 

//variable answer must be declared! 
//If the answer is not !=, prompt will run
//Correct answer is true. Will loop until true is entered.
